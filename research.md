I have projects in three broad areas which I will outline below.

## Group Exams
I have active research projects looking at different aspects of student dynamics present in group exams.  These include both social dynamics, *How do students choose who they will work with?* and cognitive dynamics, *How do group exams shape student conceptions about physical ideas?*

## Learning Assistant social dynamics
*Coming Soon*

## Pathways through STEM
*Coming Soon*
