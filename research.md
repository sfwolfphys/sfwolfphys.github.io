I have projects in four broad areas which I will outline below.

## Group Exams
I have active research projects looking at different aspects of student dynamics present in group exams.  These include both social dynamics, *How do students choose who they will work with?* and cognition, *How do group exams shape student conceptions about physical ideas?*  

Students who have collaborated with me on this work:
- Cody Blakeney
- Timothy Sault
- Erik (Tyler) Carr
- Aaron Bain

## Learning Assistant social dynamics


## Pathways through STEM
Student participation in STEM, in general, and physics, in particular, is an interesting subject to me.  We want students to 
How do students get into STEM?  How do the programs that we create to support students actually work?  
What kinds of techniques can we use to visualize the pathways through STEM that effectively communicate with university, statewide, and national stakeholders.

Students who have collaborated with me on this work:
- Patricia Malcolm
- Ryan Mezera

## Assessment in Physics Laboratories (and beyond)
My [research collaborative](http://stemcore.ecu.edu) has implemented lab curricula across disciplines utilizing the [Argument Driven Inquiry](http://dx.doi.gov/10.1021/ed100622h) framework.  We are developing a assessments within each discipline grounded in both the ADI framework and the NGSS Science Practices.

Collaborators:
- Joi Walker
- Mark Sprague
- Feng Li
