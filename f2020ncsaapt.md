## XLABs Team:
Our team has been busy transforming labs in Biology and Chemistry, as well as physics. These curricula are appropriate for any college-level intro course commonly taught.  [Check out our page](http://blog.ecu.edu/sites/xlabs/) if you want to learn more about our work including:

- How we are assessing scientific practices across scientific disciplines--and use these assessments to fulfill General Education assessment requirements.
- How we train our GTAs to implement ADI
- Who is involved in the project
- What DBER (Discipline-Based Education Research) is this curriculum founded on
