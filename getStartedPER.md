## IRB Training

IRB stands for Institutional Review Board.  It is the group on campus that oversees human subject research.  You should complete the training.  Directions are included [on their webpage](https://rede.ecu.edu/umcirb/mandatory-training/citi-training/).  You should complete the `Group 2 â€“ Social and Behavioral Research Investigators and Key Personnel` modules.

In general, this training takes about an hour.  Note that you can go back and fix your mistakes when you do the CITI training.  They will want you to upload a CITI completion certificate onto your [epirate profile](https://epirate.ecu.edu/app/).

## Slack workspace

I use Slack to communicate with my research team.  This is a fully cross platform (and free) tool.  I recommend downloading the app on your phone as well as your computer.  One of the benefits of Slack is that it is code-aware.  One of the things that I work on with my research students is to develop their coding skills.  I want you to try your ideas out, but struggling unproductively isn't good for anyone.  My suggestion when you run into a problem:  Post a snippet (portion) of your code on Slack and message it to me.  (There is a specific tool for this.  Snippets are mentioned in item #18 of [this listicle](https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-use-slack/).)  Reach out to me, and I'll help you get connected.

## Install some software
If you have a computer, and want to use it for this research, great!  (If not, I have some research laptops that you can borrow.)  Everything that I recommend is free (or provided by the university license).  Note for Linux users:  most repositories like `apt` and `yum` have all of this software available.  Consult your documentation.

### The statistical programming language R
![R-logo](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png)

You can download this for free at [www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org).  This provides the basic environment for running R.  I also recommend RStudio an IDE (Interactive Development Environment)

This is also free, and has versions that can be installed on any computer.  Follow the instructions on [rstudio.com](https://rstudio.com).  RStudio sells support with their IDE, I have never used it, nor do I feel the need to recommend it.

> Note, there are many resources for learning R that exist for free on the internet.  I don't have a set that I require, as I feel the best path is to learn as you go, and support you as you solve problems with code.  Some that I have found are in the `#learningr` channel on the Slack.

### Install Anaconda Python

Anaconda provides some additional functionality with python (which I don't use much personally), but it also allows you to create Jupyter notebooks (see [jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org) for some examples of what they look like).

### Install LaTeX
I don't use Microsoft Word to write anything.  Also, most physics journals prefer LaTeX submissions (and Dr. Sprague requires it in advanced lab).  Let's get started now!  Get [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).  (Mac users will get redirected to the MacTeX distro).  Get a cup of coffee (or other beverage of choice) while this installs.

### Install Inkscape
Sometimes it is useful to make graphics by hand...well, digitally.  I often ask students to use this to make posters as well, when we present our research at conferences.  Download it from [inkscape.org](https://inkscape.org)

## Start playing with data
Seriously, start using these tools.  Try things out.  Fail.  Try again.  Ask for help.  And have fun!
